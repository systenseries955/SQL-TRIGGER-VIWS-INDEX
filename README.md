💼 SQL Learning Update: Views, Indexes &amp; Triggers ✔️ 

Today I completed an important milestone in my SQL learning journey by working with Views, Indexes, and Triggers — three powerful features that improve data security, performance, and automation in relational databases.

🔍 1. Views

I learned how to create and use SQL Views to:

Simplify complex queries

Present only selected columns for security

Provide a clean layer for reporting and analytics

Make data easier to access without exposing the underlying tables

Views help create a more organized and secure database environment.

⚡ 2. Indexes

I explored how indexes dramatically improve SQL query performance.
Key takeaways:

Indexes speed up SELECT queries

They reduce search time by avoiding full table scans

Primary Keys and Unique keys automatically create indexes

Choosing the right columns to index is essential for performance

Understanding indexing helps in designing optimized and scalable databases.

🔁 3. Triggers

I practiced building BEFORE and AFTER triggers to automate tasks such as:

Validating and correcting data before insertion

Creating backup records before deletion

Automatically updating related tables

Maintaining data consistency without manual intervention

Triggers helped me understand how automation works within the database itself.

🎯 Summary

This session strengthened my SQL foundation by covering:

Database views (for security & simplified access)

Indexes (for performance optimization)

Triggers (for automation & data integrity)
